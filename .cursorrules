# .cursorrules

# General behavior
Cursor should:
- Always use TypeScript instead of JavaScript.
- Prefer React functional components with hooks.
- Use Blueprint.js components and styling where relevant (use other libraries like three.js for canvas where relevant).
- Follow ESLint and Prettier conventions.

# File organization
- Put hooks in /src/hooks
- Put reusable UI in /src/components
- Put utility functions in /src/utils

# Naming
- Hooks start with "use"
- Components are PascalCase
- Variables are camelCase

# Modularity & Stories
- Prioritize modularity via dependency injection (DI) for components and utilities.
- Any new component should also include a colocated Storybook story.
