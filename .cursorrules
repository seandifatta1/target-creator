# .cursorrules

# General behavior
Cursor should:
- Always use TypeScript instead of JavaScript.
- Prefer React functional components with hooks.
- Use Blueprint.js components and styling where relevant (use other libraries like three.js for canvas where relevant).
- Follow ESLint and Prettier conventions.

# Documentation Files
- By default, DO NOT create .md files. Reply with text explanations instead.
- Only create .md files if explicitly requested by the user OR if the content would be significantly better served as documentation (e.g., comprehensive setup guides, API documentation, complex architecture diagrams).
- If you think a .md file might be appropriate, PROMPT the user first before creating it.

# File organization
- Put hooks in /src/hooks
- Put reusable UI in /src/components
- Put utility functions in /src/utils

# Naming
- Hooks start with "use"
- Components are PascalCase
- Variables are camelCase

# Modularity & Stories
- Prioritize modularity via dependency injection (DI) for components and utilities.
- Any new component should also include a colocated Storybook story.

# Testing
- Any new component should have a corresponding Jest test file in the same folder.
- Test files should be named `<component-name>_test.tsx` (or `_test.ts` for non-component files).
- Test files should include basic test structure but can start empty/stubbed.
