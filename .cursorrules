# .cursorrules

# General behavior
Cursor should:
- Always use TypeScript instead of JavaScript.
- Prefer React functional components with hooks.
- **ALWAYS use Blueprint.js components as the default choice** for standard UI elements:
  - Use `Button` from `@blueprintjs/core` instead of custom buttons
  - Use `Dialog` from `@blueprintjs/core` instead of custom modals
  - Use `Drawer` from `@blueprintjs/core` instead of custom drawers/panels
  - Use `Navbar` from `@blueprintjs/core` instead of custom toolbars
  - Use `Menu` and `MenuDivider` from `@blueprintjs/core` instead of custom menus
  - Use `InputGroup`, `NumericInput`, `RadioGroup`, `Radio` for form inputs
  - Use `Icon` from `@blueprintjs/icons` instead of custom SVG icons
  - Only create custom components for 3D canvas elements (Three.js) or when Blueprint doesn't provide equivalent functionality
- Preserve existing functionality and color schemes when migrating
- Follow ESLint and Prettier conventions.

# Documentation Files
- By default, DO NOT create .md files. Reply with text explanations instead.
- Only create .md files if explicitly requested by the user OR if the content would be significantly better served as documentation (e.g., comprehensive setup guides, API documentation, complex architecture diagrams).
- If you think a .md file might be appropriate, PROMPT the user first before creating it.

# File organization
- Put hooks in /src/hooks
- Put reusable UI in /src/components
- Put utility functions in /src/utils

# Naming
- Hooks start with "use"
- Components are PascalCase
- Variables are camelCase

# Modularity & Stories
- Prioritize modularity via dependency injection (DI) for components, utilities, and business logic.
- Business logic (services, managers, repositories) should be DI-friendly with clear interfaces/protocols.
- Pass dependencies as props or constructor parameters rather than importing directly.
- Any new component should also include a colocated Storybook story with story actions (using `fn()` from 'storybook/test').

# Testing
- Any new component should have a corresponding Jest test file in the same folder.
- Test files should be named `<component-name>_test.tsx` (or `_test.ts` for non-component files).
- Test files should include basic test structure but can start empty/stubbed.
